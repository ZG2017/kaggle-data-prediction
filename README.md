* pipeline:
1. data clearing, deal with missing value, categorical data to numiercial data and so on.
2. dimension reduces: using PCA to reduce the dimension of the data to save the training time.
3. apply different prediction models including LASSO, gradient boosting, random forest and so on.
4. compare the model performance on test data, and fine-tuning the best model to get the final prediction model.
